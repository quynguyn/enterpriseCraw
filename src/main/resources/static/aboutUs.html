                                this project is an excellent opportunity to develop my skills in this area.
                                I am an easy-going and hard-working individual who thrives on meeting new people
                                and experiencing new things. Working with you all would not only be an enjoyable

                                the grindy days working on deadlines. I have general understanding of front end and back
                                end, but if working in depth into any area I still need to take time and research.

                                exponentially faster, smoother and more effectively as I work through them.
